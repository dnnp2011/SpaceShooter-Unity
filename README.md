# SpaceShooter-Unity

## Description

Survival Shooter is a waved based shooter in which a child dreams of fighting off waves of corrupted stuffed animals within a nightmarish version of his own room. Built in Unity, and programmed in C#, Survival Shooter makes use of many of the advanced features of the Unity engine to craft a compelling gameplay experience. For example, using the AI Navmesh to generate valid path finding for enemy units, Raycasting for weapon hit detection, using the Unity physics engine and its associated elements (colliders, rigidbodies) to detect physical collisions. Due to the massive size of the source game files, with the required dll's and other compiled dependencies, 3D Models, animations, sounds, and other game assets - the Git repository had to be prioritized with the most important aspects of gameplay that could be easily demonstrated. Therefore, the attached code link contains only the manually coded scripts that implement the logic of gameplay. Although these scripts are vital to the functioning of Survival Shooter, they only tell part of the story. There is still much more work done within Unity's built-in systems and tools that could not be converted to a Git friendly format.
